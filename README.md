# The Best Classifier IBM Assignment

I loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. I was expected to use the following algorithms to build the models:

   * k-Nearest Neighbour

   * Decision Tree

   * Support Vector Machine

   * Logistic Regression

The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics where they are applicable:

   * Jaccard index

   * F1-score

   * LogLoss
